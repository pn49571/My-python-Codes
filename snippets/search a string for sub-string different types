find(str, beg=0, end=len(string)): Determines whether str occurs in a string and outputs the index of the location. 
You can limit the search by specifying a beginning index using beg or a ending index using end.

index(str, beg=0, end=len(string)): Provides the same functionality as find(), but raises an exception when str isnâ€™t found.

replace(old, new [, max]): Replaces all occurrences of the character sequence specified by old in a 
string with the character sequence specified by new. 
You can limit the number of replacements by specifying a value for max.

rfind(str, beg=0, end=len(string)): Provides the same functionality as find(), 
but searches backward from the end of the string instead of the beginning.

rindex(str, beg=0, end=len(string)): Provides the same functionality as index(), 
but searches backward from the end of the string instead of the beginning.

startswith(prefix, beg=0, end=len(string)): Returns True when a string begins 
with the characters specified by prefix. You can limit the check by specifying a 
beginning index using beg or an ending index using end.
